How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Having easy access to the history of a file allows for more stable experimentation with code. There have already been a few times with coding when I modified a stable version in attempt to make it better. By the end of the session, the new code didn’t work as well and I had to ctrl+z until I came back to the stable version.. Ctrl+z is NOT a good way to manage source control.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Because the programmer is cognizant of what changes are being made and how impactful they are to the program it is more beneficial to have a manual save. Although automatic saving may save too often or too infrequently, the benefit to automatic saving is the user never has to remember to create a commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Programs often rely on other files (html and css). Saving an instance of multiple files in one commit takes a true snapshot of how the code should work. Google Docs contains documents that do not interact with each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Command ‘git log’ displays a history of all commits, whereas ‘git diff’ finds the changes between the two commits (separated by a space). If only one commit is placed in ‘git diff’ it returns all changes made since the beginning of the document.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Version control allows programmers to more effectively troubleshoot code and return back to a stable state. This allows for more experimentation without fear of breaking code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to try using git to start practicing version control with my code.
