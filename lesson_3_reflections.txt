When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository allows for multiple collaborators to share a space and work on the same project. It also allows for multiple devices to access the respository (maybe a developer likes to write at home and on vacation, they can write on a desktop or laptop w/o having to remember a flash drive).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually allows more control for the user. This allows the user to send updates only when it's decided the changes are useful enough. Automaticity may introduce changes the developer didn't want to include.
